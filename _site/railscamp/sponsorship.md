## Sponsorship

Ruby Australia provides financial sponsorship through their yearly sponsorship packages used to support all events over the course of a year. The committee will be able to give you a dollar value for this, and provide the details of associated sponsors and their logos, and any particular initiatives their funds should go towards.

Alongside that, you're welcome (and indeed, encouraged) to ask organisations for further support to help offset the ticket costs. It can be useful to have these additional sponsors pay for specific camp expenses, such as:

- transport (coaches / trains / minibuses to and from the airport)
- diversity tickets
- soft drinks and alcoholic drinks
- coffee, tea, coffee machines and/or barista

You could also consider:

- special meals like bbqs or brisket?
- a fancier selection of drinks
- hipster food trucks
- some other amazing thing?

If you are confident you can get significant sponsorship you could consider subsidising the ticket price.
