<p>Rails Camps have been run successfully with one key organiser and a few helpers, or with a small team of two or three people working closely together. Running an event solo is not recommended - but even if you chose to go down that path, at least you’ve got this guide and the support of both previous organisers and the Ruby Australia committee.</p>

<h3 id="volunteers">Volunteers</h3>

<p>Having a few people you can call upon across the course of the event itself is essential. These people should mostly be locals - bonus points if they’ve got a car to help with transporting gear. Students and others who couldn’t otherwise afford a ticket are good people to ask - they get a free ticket, and get to engage with the community in a more directed fashion.</p>

<p>Volunteers can be especially useful for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assisting with allocating name badges and t-shirts.</li>
  <li>Herding people to wash their dishes.</li>
  <li>Managing the bus trips with role calls and headcounts.</li>
  <li>Supervising kitchen access, alcohol access, materials for bonfires, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="internships--buddy-system">Internships / Buddy system</h3>

<p>If you’re keen to help out in a <em>future</em> camp, it may be worth offering to volunteer for the upcoming one, so you can get a better idea of what’s involved without being in charge. This could be something that becomes more formalised, if plans are made in advance more often.</p>
