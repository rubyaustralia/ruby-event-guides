<p>This is a rough guide - if you fall behind it’s not the end of the world, but certainly good to be on top of things sooner rather than later!</p>

<ul>
  <li>6 months out: confirm a venue</li>
  <li>4 months out: release tickets</li>
  <li>1 month out: close registrations</li>
  <li>2 weeks out: confirm numbers with the venue and caterers</li>
  <li>Monday evening after the camp: collapse into bed after a job well done.</li>
</ul>

<p>The deadlines to confirm numbers with the venue and the caterers are worth confirming - it’s good to know the very latest numbers can be updated, in case of late registrations.</p>

<h3 id="budget">Budget</h3>

<p>Camp budget templates can be supplied by previous organisers, which will provide a good starting point.</p>

<p>Income will likely come from two sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tickets</li>
  <li>Sponsorship</li>
</ul>

<p>Expenses will include some/most of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Venue</li>
  <li>Catering</li>
  <li>Transport</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these items are discussed in their respective sections of this guide.</p>

<p>Get some numbers into a spreadsheet (perhaps copied off a previous camp’s budget), and spend some time understanding the amount of funds required for such an event, and especially what the minimum numbers are to break even.</p>

<p>Having conversations with the Ruby Australia treasurer regularly is recommended, to ensure things are tracking along at a healthy level. If it turns out that despite best intentions (and all the plans you’ve made and followed) you do make a small loss, this is not the end of the world. Ruby Australia does allow for these situations and can cover the shortfall. That said, do your very best to make a small profit.</p>

<h3 id="invoices">Invoices</h3>

<p>You will also have the assistance of the Ruby Australia treasurer for issuing and paying any invoices required for the event.</p>

<h3 id="attendees">Attendees</h3>

<p>Numbers vary for camps for a variety of reasons - the location, the dates, people’s interests changing, etc. It’s not unexpected for a camp to have 100+ attendees, but excellent camps have been run with 50 attendees. It’s recommended you opt for a modest number as part of your planning for breaking even (and previous organisers can help suggest what that might be).</p>
