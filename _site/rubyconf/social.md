## Social Events

Alongside the conference proper, a core part of the overall experience are the related social events. It's recommended to have a variety of events, and especially events where families and partners are welcome, and that aren't focused on drinking.

Previous conferences have had events such as:

* Theme park rides
* Zoo/sanctuary visits
* Bike rides
* Beach BBQ
* Lawn bowls
* Yum cha
* Rooftop cinema
* Food/drink/walking tours

The conference traditionally runs on Thursday and Friday, and so having social events on the Saturday gives attendees a great way to continue socialising, and potentially bring family members along.
