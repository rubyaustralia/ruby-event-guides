<h2 id="updates-and-contributions">Updates and Contributions</h2>

<p>This document is open source. You’re welcome to open issues with any questions you might have, and if you’ve organised RubyConf Australia (or other events) before, please do submit pull requests with any details you feel should be covered but aren’t.</p>

<p>The Ruby Australia committee can be contacted by emailing <a href="mailto:committee@ruby.org.au">committee@ruby.org.au</a>.</p>

<h2 id="so-you-want-to-run-rubyconf-australia">So you want to run RubyConf Australia!</h2>

<p>This guide is meant to give a potential organiser a reasonably detailed list of things that must be considered when planning and running a RubyConf.</p>

<p>It is super important that an organiser does not rely on <em>only</em> this document. Talk to previous organisers and seek the help of Ruby Australia for advice and support when you need it.</p>

<h2 id="becoming-an-organiser">Becoming an organiser</h2>

<p>Around the time of each RubyConf Australia event, the Ruby Australia committee ask for expressions of interest from people who are thinking about running the conference the following year. These notices are posted to the Rails Oceania Google group and the Ruby Australia Slack account.</p>

<h2 id="now-that-youre-an-organiser-whats-next">Now that you’re an organiser, what’s next?</h2>

<p>Your first steps should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rope in some fellow volunteers to help organise</li>
  <li>Find potential venues in your chosen area and timeframe</li>
  <li>Put together a budget</li>
</ul>

<p>Please keep in mind that previous organisers and the Ruby Australia committee will all be happy to provide feedback along the way.</p>

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Am I personally exposed to financial risk if I make a mistake with budgeting?</p>

    <p>No. Ruby Australia has your back, but it is definitely worth maintaining a budget spreadsheet that can be shared with the Ruby Australia treasurer to mitigate the risk of financial errors occurring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will I need to cover any costs myself?</p>

    <p>All costs should ideally be covered by ticket sales and sponsorship. However, it’s likely that some extra unforeseen costs will come up during the conference itself, or for things that are planned but must be purchased personally before being reimbursed by Ruby Australia.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does Ruby Australia have insurance that covers the event? Is additional insurance required?</p>

    <p>Ruby Australia has insurance for all events run under its banner, which includes RubyConf Australia. It is <em>possible</em> that you may require additional insurance if your venue requests it - if this happens, the Ruby Australia committee will be able to help you sort it out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do I <em>have to</em> charge GST?</p>

    <p>Yes. Your ticket prices must include GST. 10% of the ticket price is not yours to spend. Budget for this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Where can I get hold of the @rubyconf_au Twitter account details?</p>

    <p>The Ruby Australia committee can provide these details to you.</p>
